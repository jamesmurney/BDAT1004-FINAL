A client has asked our team to build a proof of concept "Web" application to demonstrate
our abilities as a team. They have informed us they are prepared to contract our team for
several years however, they have many other bids to review. We need to show
them why our team is right for the job.

XYZ Corporation has asked to see a 15-minute presentation that incorporates the following:
• Produce a presentation using presentation software
o Show the Project Summary
o Talk about our team and skills
• Demonstrate our application using a URL that can be accessed outside of a local machine
o Use a cloud server such as Microsoft Azure/GoCloud/Amazon AWS
• Allow time for questions

The key points they would like to see in our presentation are:
1. Demonstrate the acquisition of a data source from a remote source (URL)
o Use a data set that is meaningful and would demonstrate your
understanding of the type of data XYZ would be interested in
o Use Python to acquire data and store into a database
2. Store acquired data in a database
o Use a cloud database you choose the type of database you feel is most
appropriate (RDMS: SQL, PostgreSQL, mySQL or noSQL:
MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra, or something else you want to try)
o Use Python to run a pseudo-batch process that runs every 24-hours to
acquire data and store in this database
▪ Describe how your process functions
3. Display results on a Web Site
o Use a web application framework like Flask or Django, server-side
code will be python
o Use JavaScript on the client side to display a dashboard visualization
of the data using charts and graphs (for example using Google Charts)
o Conduct a fit gap analysis
