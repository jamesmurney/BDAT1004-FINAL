from pymongo import MongoClient

#CONNECT TO THE DATABASE CLIENT
try:
    client = MongoClient('') # replace with own credentials for MongoDB account
    print("Connected successfully!!!")
except:
    print("Could not connect to MongoDB")

# Define database and collection

db = client[''] # add name for the Database
records = db[''] # add name for the Collection

# this connects to the Database and Collections 
# can have multiple Collections in a Database

I haven't included the code for adding data to MongoDB. There are various ways of doing it (insert_one, insert_many, etc) depending on what you're doing.
